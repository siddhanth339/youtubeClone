**This is a front-end clone of the YouTube app built using React.**

The header has a sidebar for navigation, a search bar to search videos and a user icon.
The search bar has been built using the concept of debouncing.

Home page fetches the most popular videos from the YouTube data API and renders them.

Clicking on the thumbnail of a video on the watch page takes you to the Watch Container.
This page has the video fetched from Youtube, a simple UI of the comments section along with cascaded replies built with recursion and a running live chat window.
